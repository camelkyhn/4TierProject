# 4TierProject

A basic 4 Tier e-commerce web application with asp.net, sqlexpress server, entity framework code first and some jquery. Common layer is for any class or service that is used by other layers like entities, configuration reader(ConfigHelper.cs) and etc., data acccess layer(DAL) is for database classes like database context and initializer, business logic layer(BLL) for classes like message services, repositories, user management and the last one is the presentation layer(WEB.UI) for user interface with an MVC template. Project contains asp.net identity, entitiy framework, custom role based authorizations, email confirmations, facebook login(there was a google login but facebook was enough), jquery at some shopping cart actions and some facebook posts to test getting facebook information of the user. Last thing that I wanna mention is that do not forget to change the keys in the appSettings tag of the root webconfig file for informations of smtp server and facebook app and change the project url from "projectdirectory\\.vs\config\applicationhost.config" to your exact ip address or just to "localhost:someport" and don't forget to check the connection string for db from root web.config file.
